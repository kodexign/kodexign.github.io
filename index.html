    <p><br>Hello! I'm Kalia Xiong!</p>
        I'm a female Hmong American with a keen eye for detail. I'm usually a quick learner, creative, and a culturally competent individual with a great sense of humor~ once I get comfortable.
        <br> During my free time, I enjoy reading, watching asian dramas, listening to music, going on walks, hanging out with my nieces and nephew, traveling when I can afford it (unfortunately not enough), and learning new things when they pique my interest.
